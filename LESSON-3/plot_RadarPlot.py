Radar plots
=====================

In this lesson, we go step-by-step through the process of making player radars
for a striker. We calculate the following metrics directly from
a count of actions in the Wyscout event data,

- Non-penalty goals
- Assists
- Key passes
- Smart passes
- Ariel duels won
- Ground attacking duels won

We add tho these our own calculations of,

- non-penalty expected goals.
- passes ending in final third
- receptions in final third.

# Calculating xG value

# Calculating passes ending in final third and receptions in final third
# ----------------------------
# These 2 statistics capture how good a player is in receiving and passing th
# ball in the final third. These statistics add context to passes. It isn't enough
# for a striker to be a good passer of the ball he or she should be able to perform well in the final third.
#
# To get the information about receptions, the basic idea is that the player who made
# the next action was the receiver.  We filter successful passes that ended in the final third and get the passes
# as well as the receiver. As in the last step, we sum them by player and merge these dataframes
# to return one. Note that we use

# Calculating possession
# ----------------------------
# As the next step we would like to adjust our plot by the player's team ball possesion while they 
# were on the pitch. To do it, for each row of our dataframe with minutes per player per each game 
# we take all the events that were made in this game while the player was on the pitch.
# We will also use duels, but
# don't include lost air duels and lost ground defending duels. Why? Possesion is calculated as number of touches by team divided
# by the number all touches. If a player lost ground defending duel, that means that he could have been dribbled by, so he did not
# touch the ball. If they lost the air duel, they lost a header. Therefore, we claim that those were mostly events where player may have not
# touched the ball (or if he did the team did not take control over it). We sum 
# both team passes and these duels and all passes and these duels in this period. We store these values in a 
# dictionary. Then, summing them for each player separately and calculating their ratio, we get 
# the possesion of the ball by player's team while he was on the pitch. As the last step we merge it with our summary dataframe.
