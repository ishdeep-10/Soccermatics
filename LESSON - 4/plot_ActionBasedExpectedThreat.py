# Opening the dataset
# ----------------------------
#
# First we open the data. It is the file created in the Possesion Chain segment. The files that we open are available here
# `here <https://github.com/soccermatics/Soccermatics/tree/main/course/lessons/possession_chain>`_. There are prepared using the script
# from the `previous section <https://soccermatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/lesson4/plot_PossesionChain.html>`_.

import glob
json_files_path = 'C:/Users/acer/Documents/GitHub/Soccermatics-1/course/lessons/possession_chain/*.json'

# Initialize an empty list to store individual DataFrames
dfs = []

# Loop through each JSON file and read it into a DataFrame
for json_file in json_files:
    with open(json_file, 'r') as file:
        # Use the `pd.read_json` function to read the JSON file into a DataFrame
        df = pd.read_json(file)
        
        # Append the DataFrame to the list
        dfs.append(df)

# Concatenate all DataFrames in the list into a single DataFrame
df = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True)
df = df.reset_index()

# Preparing variables for models
# ----------------------------
#
# For our models we will use all non-linear combinations of the starting and ending
# x coordinate and *c* - distance from the middle of the pitch. We create combinations
# with replacement of these variables - to get their non-linear transfomations. As the next step,
# we multiply the columns in the combination and create a model with them. 

#model variables
var = ["x0", "x1", "c0", "c1"]

#combinations
inputs = []
#one variable combinations
inputs.extend(combinations_with_replacement(var, 1))
#2 variable combinations
inputs.extend(combinations_with_replacement(var, 2))
#3 variable combinations 
inputs.extend(combinations_with_replacement(var, 3))

#make new columns
for i in inputs:
    #columns length 1 already exist 
    if len(i) > 1:
        #column name 
        column = ''
        x = 1
        for c in i:
            #add column name to be x0x1c0 for example
            column += c
            #multiply values in column
            x = x*df[c]

# Calculating action-based Expected Threat values for passes
# ----------------------------
#
# To predict the outcome of a shot, we trained a model (XGB classifier) on Bundesliga dataset. In the code we use
# model saved in the file. It was trained using *xgboost* library version 1.6.2.
# Training steps are provided commented out. Using it we predict
# probability of a chain ending with a shot. Then, on chains that ended with a shot, we fit a linear regression 
# to calculate the probability that a shot ended with a goal. Product of these 2 values is our action-based Expected Threat statistic.

### TRAINING, it's not perfect ML procedure, but results in AUC 0.2 higher than Logistic Regression
