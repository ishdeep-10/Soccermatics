# First we open the data. It is exactly the same way as we did earlier. However, this time

# Preparing data 
# ----------------------------
#
# First we see create a new column with the next event. We create a column with 1 if the ball
# was kicked out - to mark when the chain should be stopped. We filter out *Interruptions* since
# there was an ball out of the pitch or foul before them. Then, we filter lost duels, since Wyscout
# duels are saved twice - for both team either defensive or offensive. We filter out
# events "Out of ball" since we can get this information from other column. Then, we filter 
# out events by goalkeepers, since shots were made before. 

next_event = df.shift(-1, fill_value=0)
df["nextEvent"] = next_event["subEventName"]
df["kickedOut"] = df.apply(lambda x: 1 if x.nextEvent == "Ball out of the field" else 0, axis = 1)
#interruptions out
interruption = df.loc[df["eventName"] == "Interruption"]
#probably need to drop "others on the ball event" - nope
# filter out non-accurate duels - in wyscout they are 2 way - attacking and defending
lost_duels = df.loc[df["eventName"] == "Duel"]
lost_duels = lost_duels.loc[lost_duels.apply (lambda x:{'id':1802} in x.tags, axis = 1)]
df = df.drop(lost_duels.index)

# Isolating possesion chain
# ----------------------------
#
# Then, we isolate possesion chain with the rule that if the ball was touched once by 
# a different team, it should not change the results. If there was a foul, ball kicked out
# of the field the chain is stopped. For others in the ball, if the ball was properly intercepted
# that is, the next team is the one that made the next event, we stop the chain. Otherwise,
# if the ball was only touched, but did not change possesion, we treat a pass as an accurate one.
# Note that this is an approximate of true possesion chain. In the industry you will work
# on datasets with possesion chains already isolated.
