# Actions moving the ball 
# -----------------------
# To calculate the Expected Threat we need actions that move the ball. First we filter them
# from the database. Then, we remove passes that ended out of the pitch.
# To make our calculations easier we create new columns with coordinates,
# one for each coordinate.
# Then, we plot the location of actions moving the ball on 2D histogram.
# Note that dribbling is also an action that moves the ball.
# However, Wyscout does not store them in
# the v2 version that we are using in the course and
# not all ground attacking duels are dribblings.
# In the end we store number of actions in each bin in a *move_count* array to calculate later
# move probability.

# the move_expected_payoff, which is what the payoff (probability of a goal) will be
# if the player passes the ball. It is this which is the xT
#
# By iterating this process 6 times, the xT gradually converges to its final value.
